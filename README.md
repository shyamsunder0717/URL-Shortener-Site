This is a comprehensive, full-stack URL shortener application designed to simulate a production-scale service. It includes a modern frontend, a robust backend with an API, and a complete analytics dashboard. The entire application is containerized with Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Run, showcasing a complete development-to-deployment workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

This project is more than just a simple app; it's a demonstration of production-ready engineering concepts.

### Frontend
- **Modern, Responsive UI:** A creative and animated user interface built with HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring a great experience on any device.
- **Dynamic Results:** Real-time feedback when a URL is shortened, including the new link and a direct link to its analytics page.
- **Asynchronous API Calls:** Uses the `fetch` API to communicate with the backend without reloading the page.
- **Visual Feedback:** Interactive elements with hover effects, loading states, and copy-to-clipboard animations.

### Backend
- **RESTful API:** A clean API endpoint (`/api/shorten`) for creating new short URLs.
- **High-Performance Redirects:** The core of the service, redirecting short URLs to their original destination with a 301 status code.
- **Full Analytics Suite:**
    - **Individual Link Tracking:** Every link has its own stats page (`/:shortKey/stats`) showing clicks and creation date.
    - **Overall Service Dashboard:** A comprehensive admin panel (`/admin/dashboard`) displaying service-wide metrics and a detailed table of all generated links.

### Production-Scale Simulations
To demonstrate an understanding of scalable systems, this application simulates several key production features:
- **Base62 Encoding:** Generates clean, unique, non-sequential short URL keys from a numeric counter, just like production systems (e.g., `bit.ly`). This is more efficient and predictable than using random strings.
- **Simulated Redis Caching:** Implements an in-memory cache to simulate how a high-speed data store like Redis would be used. The first request for a URL queries the "database," while subsequent requests are served instantly from the "cache," dramatically reducing latency.
- **API Rate Limiting:** Includes middleware to track requests by IP address and temporarily block users who exceed a certain number of requests in a given time window, protecting the service from abuse.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Google Cloud

This application is designed for easy deployment to a serverless platform like Google Cloud Run.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) installed and configured.
    - A Google Cloud project with Billing, Cloud Run API, and Artifact Registry API enabled.

2.  **Deploy Command:**
    From the root of the project directory, run the following command. The `Dockerfile` in the repository contains all the necessary instructions.

    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy my-url-shortener --source . --allow-unauthenticated
    ```

This command will automatically containerize the application, push the image to Google Artifact Registry, and deploy it as a public service on Cloud Run.
